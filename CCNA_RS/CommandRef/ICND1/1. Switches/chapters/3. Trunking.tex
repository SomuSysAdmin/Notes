\section{Trunking : Introduction}
Since we don't want to mix the traffic between the VLANs, and since they're in different subnets, if we have to send traffic between multiple switches in our network, it might seem like we need separate interfaces to carry the traffic for each VLAN, but that's not the case, since we can use trunk ports. Trunk interfaces allow us to send the data for multiple VLANs over a single connection.
