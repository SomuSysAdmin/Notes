	\section{Introducing KVM Virtualization}
	There are some basic requirements for KVM Virtualization on a server: 
	
	\subsection{CPU Virtualization Support}
	The CPU needs to be capable to support virtualization. This can be easily verified using the command:
	
	\vspace{-15pt}
	\begin{minted}{console}
	grep -e "vmx|svm" /proc/cpuinfo
	\end{minted}
	\vspace{-10pt}
	
	The presence of the \verb|vmx| flag is the indication that the CPU supports Intel's VT-x virtualization. However, for AMD processors, the equivalent is \verb|svm| indicating the presence of AMD's SVM technology.
