\chapter{Managing LVM Logical Volumes}

\section{Why use LVM}
LVM provides a flexible approach to storage:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Volumes can consist of more than one disk.
	\item Volumes can be made smaller or larger easily.
	\item It is easy to replace failing disks.
	\item Provides advanced options like working with snapshots - a method by which backups can be made of files while they're open!
	\item It is easy to add many new volumes. While with partitions, there is a limit of 15 partitions, there can be as many as 256 logical volumes. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Understanding LVM Setup}
When working with LVM, we always start with physical storage media such as a hard disk (\textit{sda}). Typically, a partition on the hard disk is marked as the physical volume. Now, this physical volume is added to the \textbf{volume group} which is essentially an abstraction of all the storage available. Thus, all logical volumes are created from this volume group, and from their perspective, the physical volume that's acting as it's storage media isn't important. 

Once the logical volume is made from the storage in the volume group, we get a device called \verb|/dev/vgroup/logvol|. This is the device for the logical volume on which we create the file system. As long as there is space on the volume group, we can add new logical volumes on it. If there isn't we can also add a physical volume to the volume group, to increase its capacity.

\section{Creating an LVM Logical Volume}

To create a new LVM partition, first we need to make a partition like any other partition.

Now that we have specified the details of our new partition, we need to change one more before we can use the LVM partitions. We enter the command \verb|t| to change the partition type, and then show the overview of all the acceptable partition types using \verb|l|. From the command below, we can see that there is a partition type called \textbf{Linux LVM} which suits our requirements.

\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
We enter the value \verb|8e| since it's the code for the Linux LVM partition that we need. Finally, we use \verb|p| to print the partition table and verify our partition, \verb|w| to save the changes and \verb|partprobe| to push the changes to the kernel. 

\subsection{Creating a Physical Volume}
A physical volume is just a partition with the LVM metadata added to it. The volume groups built from the PVs are not possible to build without this metadata stored in the partitions. The physical volumes are created using \verb|pvcreate|. We can show all physical volumes using \verb|pvs|. 

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# pvcreate /dev/sdb2
Physical volume "/dev/sdb2" successfully created.
# pvs
PV         VG     Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree  
/dev/sda3  centos lvm2 a--  <14.91g   4.00m
/dev/sdb2         lvm2 ---  100.00m 100.00m
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
The \verb|pvs| command tells us that we have a physical volume called \verb|/dev/sdb2| which isn't in a volume group yet, has a LVM2 formatting, has a partition size of 100MB and has the same amount of free space. 

\subsection{Creating a Volume Group}

Next, we create a new volume group using the \verb|vgcreate| command. Again, we can check the volume groups on our system using the \verb|vgs| command. 

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# vgcreate vgPrime /dev/sdb2
Volume group "vgPrime" successfully created
# vgs
VG      #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize   VFree 
centos    1   4   0 wz--n- <14.91g  4.00m
vgPrime   1   0   0 wz--n-  96.00m 96.00m
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
The volume group \textit{vgPrime} has 1 PV in it (\textit{/dev/sda2}), no logical volumes, And has a Volume size of 96MB, all of which is free!

\subsection{Creating a Logical Volume}
The creating of a Logical Volume on a VG requires specifying the size of the logical volume. This can be done in two ways: by counting the number of extents (building blocks of LVM) [\verb|-l|] or the actual size on disk (KB, MB, GB, TB, etc.)[\verb|-L|]. Finally, we also can provide the name of the LV using the \verb|-n| option. 

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# lvcreate -n lvPrime -L 96M vgPrime
Logical volume "lvPrime" created.
# lvs
LV      VG      Attr       LSize  Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
home    centos  -wi-ao----  7.45g                                                    
root    centos  -wi-ao----  3.72g                                                    
swap    centos  -wi-ao----  1.86g                                                    
var     centos  -wi-ao----  1.86g                                                    
lvPrime vgPrime -wi-a----- 96.00m                
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\subsection{Creating a File system on the LV}
Now, since the LV is ready, we can put a file system on it. We refer to the logical volume device by \verb|/dev/<volumeGroupName>/<logicalVolumeName>|.

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}

/dev/mapper/vgPrime-lvPrime on /mnt type ext2 (rw,relatime,seclabel)
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
Here, we can see that there is a strange behavior with the device that is mounted. While we issued the command to mount \verb|/dev/vgPrime/lvPrime|, the device that was actually mounted is shown as \verb|/dev/mapper/vgPrime-lvPrime|. This is because both those names are symlinks to the real name of the device (\textit{dm-5}):

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# ls -l /dev/mapper/vgPrime-lvPrime /dev/vgPrime/lvPrime
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 7 Dec 11 15:13 /dev/mapper/vgPrime-lvPrime -> ../dm-5
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 7 Dec 11 15:13 /dev/vgPrime/lvPrime -> ../dm-5
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
The device \verb|/dev/dm-5| is a Device Mapper device, which is the same as used in case of LUKS encrypted volumes. 

\section{Understanding Device Mapper and LVM Device Names}
The device mapper is an abstraction layer that the kernel works with to communicate with certain types of storage devices. Both LUKS encrypted partitions and LVM use the device mapper. Other devices such as software RAID and multipath also have to communicate via the device mapper. 

Contrastingly, the XFS, Ext4, etc file systems work with the help of the VFS (Virtual File System) layer (instead of the Device Mapper abstraction layer). The device mapper has the devices present as \verb|dm-*| (\textit{dm-0, dm-1, etc.}) but we shouldn't use them. The names are assigned during boot, and are subject to change at any time! This is why the device mapper provides a bunch of symlinks to the related devices in the \verb|/device/mapper| directory. They are: \verb|/dev/mapper/vg-lv| and \verb|/dev/vg/lv| which are both symlinks to the same device. 

\section{Understanding LVM resize operations}
The structure of LVMs are simple: the file system (FS) are installed on Logical Volumes (LV). These Logical Volumes get their disk space from Volume Groups (VG) which use several Physical Volumes (PV) that actually hold the data and provides the disk space. 

\subsection{Extending the File System}
To expand the disk capacity of the file system, we need more space in the Logical volume. This means that (possibly) more space has to be added to the Volume Group itself, and thus, more physical volumes may need to be added. 

So, first we need to create a new physical volume, and then assign it to the volume group. Then it is possible to grow the logical volume, and finally extend the file system. 

\subsection{Shrinking the File System}
At first we have to reduce the size of the file system, and then reduce the size of the logical volume. If we don't there will be a file system with a bigger size than the logical partition it's residing on. 

Thus, after reducing the file system size and then the logical volume size, we can then reduce the size of the volume group (if needed). 

\section{Growing an LVM Logical Volume}
We can grow the LVM volume if we're running out of disk space and want to make it bigger. We typically check the amount of free space using \verb|df -h| (\textit{disk free - human-readable}) command:

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# df -h
Filesystem                   Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/centos-root      3.8G  3.6G  163M  96% /

\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
Now, since it's an LVM, the order in which we grow the different components matter. To make the filesystem bigger, first we check the LV size and then check to see if there's any free space in the VG:

\noindent
From the last line of the command, we can see that vgPrime has 0 VFree (i.e., free space in the VG). Thus, we need to work bottom up and make it bigger before we can make the LV and the FS bigger. So, we run \verb|fdisk| on \textit{/dev/sdb}.

\subsection{Creating a new logical volume in an extended partition to add to the VG}
Now, we add a new partition. However, since on the given disk there's already 3 primary partitions, and there can only be a total of 4 partitions on a disk (max of 3 primary and 1 extended that can contain several logical partitions), the system defaults the last partition to be an extended one. 

\vspace{-15pt}

\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
Typically, we want the extended partition to take whatever disk space is left, since otherwise the space is wasted and rendered unusable due to the MBR convention used by BIOS. However, if UEFI is used, the usage of GUID (Globally Unique ID) Partition Tables (GPT) which lifts this restriction. 

Now, we have to add a logical partition on the disk. Since all 4 partitions are in use, the system defaults to adding a new logical partition on the extended partition automatically. We add the new partition and then change the partition type (using \verb|t|) to \textit{Linux LVM} by providing the code \verb|8e|.

Now we save the configuration and use the \verb|partprobe| command to update the kernel's information about the available partitions.

\subsection{Extending the Volume Group}
Next let us consider we want to extend the existing LVM partition on \textit{/dev/sdb3}. Then, we use the \verb|vgextend| command to extend the LVM partition. It requires a Volume Group name, and a Physical device path, with the intention of adding the entire physical device to the VG. This is a \textit{shortcut} since we don't have to create a PV on the device to be added (\textit{/dev/sdb5}), as when all conditions are met, the \verb|vgextend| command itself creates a PV on the disk, after which the disk is extended. 

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# vgextend vgCLI /dev/sdb5
Physical volume "/dev/sdb5" successfully created.
Volume group "vgCLI" successfully extended
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
Now, we can extend the logical volume to take up as much space on the VG as we want. We can confirm that our VG has been extended with the \verb|vgs| command, and we can see which PVs are included in it (and confirm if \textit{/dev/sdb5} is present in it), using the \verb|pvs| command. 

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# vgs

\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\subsection{Extending the LV and the File System}
The LV is extended using the \verb|lvextend| command, that takes as an argument:

\vspace{-10pt}
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{lM{0.85}}
	\toprule
	\textbf{Options} &\textbf{Description} \\
	\midrule
	\textbf{-L}	&Absolute size in KiB/MiB/GiB \\
	\textbf{-l}	&The number of logical extents \textbf{OR} a percentage of either the VG size, the LV/PV size or the free space available in the VG, etc. \\
	\midrule
	\textbf{-r}	&Also resizes the file system on the LV, irrespective of file system. \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\noindent
The complete \verb|lvextend| command then looks like:

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# lvextend -l +100%FREE -r /dev/vgCLI/lvCLI
Phase 1 - find and verify superblock...
Phase 2 - using internal log

The last few lines are the output from the \verb|mkfs.xfs| command which is used to resize the file system on the disk. Had the filesystem been XFS, the \verb|resize2fs| utility would've been used instead. The result of the operation can be verified using the \verb|df -h| command and checking the file system size.

\section{Shrinking an LVM logical Volume}
The shrinking operation of an LVM needs to be supported by the file system on board the LV. This is not the case for XFS as it doesn't support shrinking. \textbf{To shrink a LV, the file system on it must be unmounted first!} The size of the FS then must be reduced before shrinking the LV. To resize the Ext4 FS, we use \verb|resize2fs| utility, which is the \textit{xt2/Ext3/Ext4 File System Resizer}.

If we directly try to run the resize2fs on the disk, we'll be advised to run \verb|e2fsck| utility to check file system consistency, i.e., if the file system has any problems with it. So, the commands to reduce the LV are:

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# e2fsck -f /dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI 
e2fsck 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)

Size of logical volume vgCLI/lvCLI changed from 100.00 MiB (25 extents) to 52.00 MiB (13 extents).
Logical volume vgCLI/lvCLI successfully resized.
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
Now, if there weren't any errors, we should be able to mount the file system on board the LV. 

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# mount /dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI /LVM/
# mount | grep ^/dev
/dev/mapper/centos_cliserver-root on / type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
/dev/sda1 on /boot type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
/dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI on /LVM type ext4 (rw,relatime,seclabel,data=ordered)
# df -h /dev/vgCLI/lvCLI 
Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI   45M  1.1M   40M   3% /LVM
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
In the last line we see that the file system size has been properly reduced. 

\subsection{Reduce both File system and LV in a single step}
It is possible to shrink the LV and the on-board FS in a single command: (\textit{The} \verb|-r| \textit{option automatically resizes the FS before shrinking the LV}).

\vspace{-15pt}
\begin{minted}{console}
# umount /LVM
# lvreduce -L 35M -r /dev/vgCLI/lvCLI 
Rounding size to boundary between physical extents: 36.00 MiB.
fsck from util-linux 2.23.2

resize2fs 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
Resizing the filesystem on /dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI to 36864 (1k) blocks.
The filesystem on /dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI is now 36864 blocks long.

Size of logical volume vgCLI/lvCLI changed from 52.00 MiB (13 extents) to 36.00 MiB (9 extents).
Logical volume vgCLI/lvCLI successfully resized.
# mount /dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI /LVM
# mount | grep ^/dev
/dev/mapper/centos_cliserver-root on / type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
/dev/sda1 on /boot type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)
/dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI on /LVM type ext4 (rw,relatime,seclabel,data=ordered)
# df -h /dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI 
Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vgCLI-lvCLI   31M  783K   28M   3% /LVM
\end{minted}
\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent
Note however, that this method won't work all the time on all file systems, due to the fact that the target FS must also support reduction via \verb|lvreduce -r|. Thus, while the \verb|-r| won't work on XFS, it works just fine on Ext4.
